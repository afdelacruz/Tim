---

## App Purpose
**"Time is money"** - Check your money as quickly as checking the time

Tim is a discrete iOS widget that shows monthly inflows and outflows based on account balance changes. Users connect multiple bank accounts and assign them to inflow/outflow categories.

**Development Methodology:** This project will prioritize **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**. Automated tests (unit and integration) should be written before or concurrently with feature implementation to ensure code quality, maintainability, and correctness. Test names provided in the acceptance criteria are illustrative examples; actual test names should clearly describe the specific behavior being verified.

## Core Features
- **Widget Display**: Two numbers - green inflows, red outflows
- **Account Connection**: Multiple bank accounts via Plaid
- **User Configuration**: Toggle accounts into inflow/outflow categories
- **Monthly Reset**: Resets on 1st of each month
- **Daily Updates**: Widget refreshes once daily automatically

## Widget Design
```
┌─────────────┐
│ +$1,240 ●   │  ← Green (inflows)
│ -$890  ●    │  ← Red (outflows)
└─────────────┘
```

## User Flow
1. Register with email + 4-digit PIN
2. Connect bank accounts via Plaid (checking, savings, credit cards)
3. Configure which accounts feed inflows vs outflows
4. Add widget to home screen
5. Widget shows current month balance changes

---

## Prerequisites Setup

### Step 0: Environment & Account Setup

**Goal:** Set up required accounts and development environment

**Tasks:**
1. Create Plaid developer account (sandbox access)
2. Create Apple Developer account ($99/year)  
3. Set up simple backend hosting (Railway/Render)
4. Choose database provider (PostgreSQL)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Plaid sandbox credentials obtained
- [x] Apple Developer account active
- [x] Backend hosting service selected
- [x] Database instance created

---

## Step 1: Simplified Backend

**Goal:** Minimal backend for authentication and balance tracking

**Testing Approach for Backend:** Adhere strictly to TDD. All API endpoints and core logic modules (e.g., authentication, Plaid interactions, balance calculations, database operations) must have corresponding unit and integration tests. Tests serve as a key part of the acceptance criteria. Unit tests will focus on individual modules (services, repositories, utility functions) by mocking external dependencies. Integration tests will typically target API endpoints, verifying the entire request-response cycle and interactions between components, potentially using a dedicated test database instance.

### Step 1.1: Basic Server Setup

**File Structure:**
```
backend/
├── server.js
├── package.json
├── .env
├── routes/
│   ├── auth.js
│   ├── plaid.js
│   └── balances.js
└── models/
    ├── User.js
    ├── Account.js
    └── BalanceSnapshot.js
```

**Tasks:**
- Set up Express.js server
- Configure environment variables
- Set up CORS for iOS app communication
- Basic error handling middleware

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Server starts on specified port
- [x] Environment variables loaded correctly
- [x] CORS configured for iOS requests
- [x] Basic health check endpoint (`/health`) responds with 200, verified by an automated test.
- [x] All API error responses follow a consistent JSON format, and this error handling is testable: 
  `{ "success": false, "error": { "code": "ERROR_CODE_STRING", "message": "Human-readable description." } }`
    *   Example Unit Tests for Error Handling Middleware:
        *   `testErrorMiddleware_handlesGenericError_returnsCorrectFormatAndStatusCode`: Verifies that unexpected errors are caught and formatted according to the standard error JSON structure. Ensures consistent error reporting.
        *   `testErrorMiddleware_handlesSpecificCustomError_returnsCorrectFormatAndStatusCode`: Checks that custom application errors are also formatted correctly. Ensures different error types are handled gracefully.

### Step 1.2: Simplified Database Schema

**Goal:** Simple schema for users, accounts, and balance tracking

**Database Tables:**
```sql
-- Users table
CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  pin_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Connected accounts
CREATE TABLE accounts (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  plaid_item_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, // Stores Plaid's item_id for managing the connection
  plaid_access_token VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, // Securely stored access token for Plaid API calls
  plaid_account_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, // Plaid's specific account_id
  account_name VARCHAR(255),
  account_type VARCHAR(50),
  institution_name VARCHAR(255),
  is_inflow BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  is_outflow BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  needs_reauthentication BOOLEAN DEFAULT false // Flag for Plaid item errors
);

-- Balance snapshots (for tracking changes)
CREATE TABLE balance_snapshots (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  account_id UUID REFERENCES accounts(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  balance DECIMAL(12,2) NOT NULL,
  snapshot_date DATE NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(account_id, snapshot_date)
);
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Database connection established.
- [x] All tables created with proper constraints (including `plaid_item_id`, `plaid_access_token`, and `needs_reauthentication` in `accounts` table), verified by schema inspection and test setup/teardown.
- [x] Basic CRUD operations work internally within database models/repositories, verified by unit tests for these data access components.
    *   Example Unit Tests for `UserRepository`:
        *   `testCreateUser_withValidData_savesUserCorrectly`: Ensures a new user can be successfully created and persisted in the database. Verifies the core user creation path.
        *   `testFindUserByEmail_withExistingEmail_returnsUser`: Checks that users can be retrieved by their email. Essential for login and lookups.
        *   `testFindUserByEmail_withNonExistingEmail_returnsNullOrOptionalEmpty`: Confirms that lookups for non-existent users are handled correctly (e.g., returning null or an empty optional). Prevents errors from invalid lookups.
    *   Example Unit Tests for `AccountRepository`:
        *   `testSaveAccount_withValidData_savesAccount`: Verifies that new bank account details linked by a user are saved correctly. Core to Plaid integration.
        *   `testFindAccountsByUserId_returnsCorrectAccounts`: Ensures all accounts belonging to a specific user can be retrieved. Needed for displaying user accounts.
        *   `testUpdateAccountCategories_updatesFlagsCorrectly`: Checks that inflow/outflow category settings for an account can be updated. Verifies user configuration persistence.
        *   `testSetNeedsReauthentication_forItem_updatesFlagsOnAssociatedAccounts`: Ensures accounts linked to a Plaid item are correctly flagged if Plaid requires re-authentication for that item. Key for managing Plaid connection health.
        *   `testSaveSnapshot_withValidData_savesSnapshot`: Confirms that daily balance snapshots for an account are stored. Fundamental for tracking balance changes.
        *   `testGetLatestSnapshotForAccount_returnsCorrectSnapshot`: Verifies retrieval of the most recent balance snapshot. Used for current balance display.
        *   `testGetSnapshotForAccountOnDate_returnsCorrectSnapshot`: Ensures a snapshot for a specific date can be fetched. Used for historical balance lookup (e.g., start of month).
        *   `testGetFirstSnapshotForAccountInMonth_returnsCorrectSnapshot`: Checks retrieval of the earliest snapshot in a given month. Important for calculating monthly changes.

### Step 1.3: Email + PIN Authentication

**Goal:** Simple authentication for weekend project

**API Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Register with email + PIN
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Login with email + PIN
- `POST /api/auth/refresh-token` - Obtain a new access token using a refresh token
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user info (requires access token)

**Authentication Flow:**
1. User enters email + desired PIN for registration.
2. Backend creates user, hashes PIN.
3. On login, user sends email + PIN.
4. If valid, backend returns a short-lived JWT access token and a long-lived refresh token.
5. Client stores tokens securely (access token in memory, refresh token in Keychain/secure storage).
6. For subsequent API calls, client uses access token. If expired, client uses refresh token to get a new access token.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] User registration (`POST /api/auth/register`) creates a new user with email and securely hashed PIN, verified by unit and integration tests.
    *   Example Unit Tests for Registration Logic (`AuthService`):
        *   `testRegisterUser_whenEmailNotTaken_createsUserAndReturnsTokens`: Verifies successful user creation and token generation for a new email. Ensures the primary registration path works.
        *   `testRegisterUser_whenEmailIsTaken_throwsConflictError`: Ensures the system prevents duplicate registrations with the same email, maintaining email uniqueness.
- [x] Login (`POST /api/auth/login`) with email + PIN returns a JWT access token and a refresh token, verified by unit and integration tests.
    *   Example Unit Tests for Login Logic (`AuthService`):
        *   `testLoginUser_withValidCredentials_returnsAccessTokenAndRefreshToken`: Checks that a user with correct email and PIN receives the necessary tokens for session management.
        *   `testLoginUser_withInvalidPin_throwsUnauthorizedError`: Ensures login fails if the PIN is incorrect. Prevents unauthorized access.
        *   `testLoginUser_withNonExistentUser_throwsUnauthorizedError`: Confirms login fails for emails not registered in the system.
- [x] Access token is short-lived (e.g., 15-60 minutes). Refresh token is long-lived (e.g., 30-90 days).
- [x] JWT access tokens contain necessary claims (e.g., `sub` for user ID, `iss`, `iat`, `exp`), with claims structure verified in tests.
    *   Example Unit Tests for Token Generation (`AuthService`):
        *   `testGenerateAccessToken_forUser_returnsValidJwtWithCorrectClaims`: Verifies the access token is structured correctly with all required user and token metadata.
        *   `testGenerateRefreshToken_forUser_returnsValidToken`: Ensures the refresh token is generated as expected.
- [x] `/api/auth/refresh-token` endpoint successfully exchanges a valid refresh token for a new access token, verified by unit and integration tests.
    *   Example Unit Tests for Token Refresh Logic (`AuthService`):
        *   `testVerifyRefreshToken_withValidToken_returnsUserPayloadAndAllowsNewAccessToken`: Checks that a valid refresh token can be used to obtain a new access token. Key for seamless session renewal.
        *   `testVerifyRefreshToken_withInvalidOrExpiredToken_throwsError`: Ensures that expired or invalid refresh tokens cannot be used. Maintains security.
- [ ] Authenticated endpoints (e.g., `/api/auth/me`) are protected and require a valid access token, verified by integration tests including unauthorized access attempts.
- [ ] `/api/auth/me` endpoint returns current user info, verified by integration tests.
    *   Example Unit Tests for `AuthService.me` / `UserController.me`:
        *   `testMe_givenValidUser_returnsUserInfo`: Confirms that an authenticated user can retrieve their own profile information.

**Sample Request/Response:**
```javascript
// POST /api/auth/register
{ "email": "user@example.com", "pin": "5678" }

// Response (Success 201)
{ "success": true, "message": "User registered successfully" }

// POST /api/auth/login  
{ "email": "user@example.com", "pin": "5678" }

// Response
{ 
  "success": true, 
  "accessToken": "jwt_access_token", 
  "refreshToken": "jwt_refresh_token",
  "user": {...} // basic user info
}

// POST /api/auth/refresh-token
{ "refreshToken": "jwt_refresh_token" }

// Response
{
  "success": true,
  "accessToken": "new_jwt_access_token"
}
```

## Step 2: Plaid Integration ✅ **[FULLY COMPLETE - IN FEATURE BRANCHES]**

**Goal:** Connect multiple bank accounts and fetch balances

### Step 2.1: Plaid Link Token Generation ✅ **[IMPLEMENTED]**

**API Endpoint:**
- `POST /api/plaid/link-token` - Generate Plaid Link token

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Plaid client initialized with sandbox credentials.
- [x] Link token generated successfully for a given user, verified by unit/integration tests.
    *   Example Unit Tests for `PlaidService.createLinkToken`:
        *   `testCreateLinkToken_forUser_callsPlaidClientCorrectlyAndReturnsToken`: (Mocking Plaid client) Ensures the service interacts with the Plaid API as expected to generate a link token. Verifies a crucial step in the Plaid connection flow.
        *   `testCreateLinkToken_whenPlaidClientFails_throwsError`: Checks that failures from the Plaid client during link token creation are handled and propagated correctly. Ensures robustness.
- [x] Link token includes proper user identifier (user's `id` from the `users` table).

### Step 2.2: Exchange Token & Store Accounts ✅ **[IMPLEMENTED]**

**API Endpoint:**
- `POST /api/plaid/exchange-token` - Exchange public token

**Tasks:**
- Exchange Plaid `public_token` for a `access_token` and `item_id`.
- Fetch account information from Plaid for the obtained `item_id`.
- For each account retrieved, store it in the `accounts` database table, including the `plaid_item_id`, the (securely handled) `plaid_access_token`, `plaid_account_id`, and other relevant metadata (name, type, institution).
- Assign default categories (e.g., `is_inflow = false`, `is_outflow = false`).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Public token successfully exchanged for an `access_token` and `item_id`, verified by unit/integration tests (potentially mocking Plaid API).
    *   Example Unit Tests for `PlaidService.exchangePublicToken` (Token Exchange Part):
        *   `testExchangePublicToken_withValidToken_getsAccessAndItemIdFromPlaid`: (Mocking Plaid client) Verifies the service correctly exchanges a public token for Plaid API credentials. Core to establishing a link.
        *   `testExchangePublicToken_whenPlaidClientFailsExchange_throwsError`: Ensures errors during the token exchange with Plaid are handled. Improves error reporting.
- [x] Account data fetched and stored in the `accounts` table, including Plaid `item_id` and `access_token` for each associated account record. This process is verified by integration tests.
    *   Example Unit Tests for `PlaidService.exchangePublicToken` (Account Fetch & Store Part):
        *   `testExchangePublicToken_fetchesAndStoresAccountsInDatabase`: (Mocking Plaid client and DB interactions) Confirms that after token exchange, account details are retrieved from Plaid and saved to the application's database. Validates data persistence.
        *   `testExchangePublicToken_savesCorrectPlaidItemAndAccessTokensToDb`: Ensures the correct Plaid identifiers and tokens are stored securely. Critical for future API calls.
        *   `testExchangePublicToken_whenPlaidClientFailsAccountsFetch_throwsError`: Checks error handling if Plaid fails to return account information post-exchange.
- [x] Multiple accounts from a single Plaid item are correctly stored.
- [x] Account metadata saved (name, type, institution).

### Step 2.3: Daily Balance Fetching ✅ **[IMPLEMENTED]**

**Goal:** Fetch current balances and track changes by storing daily snapshots.

**Mechanism:** A recurring daily job/function, configured using **Railway's built-in scheduler**.

**Tasks:**
- For each user, iterate through their Plaid-linked items/accounts.
- Attempt to fetch current balances using stored `plaid_access_token`.
    - If Plaid API returns an error indicating re-authentication is needed for an item (e.g., `ITEM_LOGIN_REQUIRED`):
        - Log the error.
        - Set `needs_reauthentication = true` for all accounts associated with that `plaid_item_id`.
        - For MVP, balance updates for these accounts will pause. No in-app prompt to re-authenticate will be built in this step.
    - If balance fetch is successful:
        - Set `needs_reauthentication = false` for the account.
        - Store these as new daily balance snapshots in the `balance_snapshots` table.
- This ensures the raw data for monthly calculations is consistently updated.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Balances fetched from all linked accounts for active users whose Plaid items do not require re-authentication, verified by unit/integration tests (mocking Plaid API and database interactions).
    *   Example Unit Tests for `BalanceUpdateService` / Daily Job Logic:
        *   `testFetchAndStoreBalancesForAllUsers_processesMultipleUsers`: Verifies the job can handle iterating through multiple users and their accounts. Ensures scalability of the daily update.
        *   `testFetchBalancesForUser_whenPlaidCallSucceeds_savesSnapshotsAndClearsReauthFlag`: (Mocking Plaid and DB) Confirms that successful balance fetches result in new snapshots and that any previous re-authentication flags are cleared. Validates the happy path for balance updates.
- [x] Daily snapshots stored correctly in the `balance_snapshots` database table, verified by tests.
- [x] If Plaid item requires re-authentication, the `needs_reauthentication` flag is set for associated accounts, and errors are logged. This logic is unit tested.
    *   Example Unit Tests for `BalanceUpdateService` (Plaid Error Handling):
        *   `testFetchBalancesForUser_whenPlaidItemNeedsReauthentication_setsReauthFlagAndLogsError`: Checks that specific Plaid errors trigger the `needs_reauthentication` flag and are logged. Ensures graceful failure and state management for Plaid connection issues.
        *   `testFetchBalancesForUser_whenOtherPlaidErrorOccurs_logsErrorAndDoesNotUpdate`: Confirms that other Plaid API errors are logged but do not incorrectly alter application state beyond what's necessary.
        *   `testFetchBalancesForUser_withNoAccounts_doesNothingGracefully`: Ensures the job runs without error if a user has no linked accounts.
- [x] The system is prepared for monthly change calculations as per Step 3.2.

---

## Step 3: Account Configuration ✅ **[FULLY COMPLETE - IN FEATURE BRANCHES]**

**Goal:** Let users assign accounts to inflow/outflow categories

### Step 3.1: Account Management API ✅ **[IMPLEMENTED]**

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/accounts` - Get user's connected accounts
- `PUT /api/accounts/:id/categories` - Update account categories

**Account Category Interface:**
```javascript
// PUT /api/accounts/123/categories
{
  "is_inflow": true,
  "is_outflow": false
}
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Users can view all their connected accounts via `GET /api/accounts`, verified by integration tests.
- [x] Users can toggle inflow/outflow settings for an account via `PUT /api/accounts/:id/categories`, verified by integration tests.
    *   Example Unit Tests for `AccountService.updateAccountCategories`:
        *   `testUpdateAccountCategories_withValidData_updatesRepositoryAndReturnsSuccess`: (Mocking DB) Ensures that valid category changes are persisted to the database. Verifies user settings are saved.
        *   `testUpdateAccountCategories_forNonExistentAccount_throwsNotFoundError`: Checks that attempts to update non-existent accounts are handled with an appropriate error.
        *   `testUpdateAccountCategories_forAccountNotOwnedByUser_throwsForbiddenError`: Ensures users cannot modify accounts that do not belong to them. Maintains data security.
- [x] Accounts can be in both categories (user's choice).
- [x] Changes persist in database, verified by tests.

### Step 3.2: Monthly Balance Calculation ✅ **[IMPLEMENTED]**

**Goal:** Calculate monthly inflows and outflows

**API Endpoint:**
- `GET /api/balances/current-month` - Get month-to-date balance changes

**Calculation Logic (performed by the `/api/balances/current-month` endpoint on demand):**
1. Determine the start of the current month (e.g., YYYY-MM-01).
2. For each account linked by the user:
    a. **Determine Base Balance:**
        i. For the very first month a user's account is tracked by Tim (i.e., the month the account was linked): The base balance is the account's balance recorded in the `balance_snapshots` table from its initial snapshot taken when the account was first successfully linked.
        ii. For all subsequent months: The base balance is the balance from the snapshot on (or closest prior to) the 1st of the current month. If, in a rare case, no snapshot is available around the 1st (e.g., system was down), use the earliest available snapshot in that month as the base.
    b. Retrieve the latest available balance snapshot for that account within the current month.
    c. Calculate the difference between the latest balance (2b) and the determined base balance (2a).
3. Sum positive differences for accounts the user has designated `is_inflow`. This is the total inflow.
4. Sum the absolute values of negative differences for accounts the user has designated `is_outflow`. (e.g., if balance change is -$50, it contributes $50 to outflow). This is the total outflow.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Monthly reset logic (calculations relative to the 1st of the current month, or link date for first month) works correctly, verified by comprehensive unit tests covering various scenarios (new user, mid-month signup, full month, no inflow/outflow accounts, accounts linked/delinked mid-month if applicable).
    *   Example Unit Tests for `BalanceCalculationService` (Core Logic):
        *   `testCalculateMonthlyBalances_forNewUser_firstMonth_usesLinkDateBalanceAsBase`: Ensures calculations for a user's first month use their initial linked balance as the starting point. Critical for accurate onboarding UX.
        *   `testCalculateMonthlyBalances_forExistingUser_fullMonth_usesFirstOfMonthBalanceAsBase`: Verifies that for subsequent months, the balance from the 1st of the month is used as the baseline. Standard monthly calculation.
        *   `testCalculateMonthlyBalances_withOnlyInflowAccount_calculatesInflowCorrectly`: Checks correct summation for accounts designated only for inflows.
        *   `testCalculateMonthlyBalances_withOnlyOutflowAccount_calculatesOutflowCorrectly`: Checks correct summation for accounts designated only for outflows.
        *   `testCalculateMonthlyBalances_withMixedAccounts_calculatesBothCorrectly`: Ensures accounts contributing to both inflow and outflow (e.g., credit card used for spending then paid off) are handled if such user configurations are allowed and make sense, or that such configurations are handled as defined (e.g. if one account can only be one type).
        *   `testCalculateMonthlyBalances_withNoCategorizedAccounts_returnsZeroTotals`: Verifies that if no accounts are categorized, totals are zero. Prevents miscalculation.
        *   `testCalculateMonthlyBalances_withNoSnapshotsAvailable_returnsZeroTotals`: Ensures graceful handling if balance data is missing.
        *   `testCalculateMonthlyBalances_accountBalanceIncreases_isCorrectInflowOrReducedOutflow`: Validates how positive balance changes affect inflow/outflow totals based on account category.
        *   `testCalculateMonthlyBalances_accountBalanceDecreases_isCorrectOutflowOrReducedInflow`: Validates how negative balance changes affect inflow/outflow totals based on account category.
        *   `testCalculateMonthlyBalances_accountBalanceUnchanged_isZeroChange`: Confirms no change in balance results in no change to inflow/outflow totals.
- [x] Inflow calculation sums correctly, verified by unit tests.
- [x] Outflow calculation sums correctly, verified by unit tests.  
- [x] Accounts not in any category don't affect totals, verified by unit tests.
- [x] API (`GET /api/balances/current-month`) returns current month totals accurately, verified by integration tests.

## Step 4: iOS App

**Goal:** Simple iOS app with account configuration

**Testing Approach for iOS:** Employ TDD principles. Core service logic (e.g., `AuthService.swift`, `PlaidService.swift`, `BalanceService.swift`), ViewModels (or equivalent architectural components like Presenters/Interactors), and any complex data transformation or state management logic should be unit tested using XCTest. Unit tests will verify the logic of individual classes and structs. For services and ViewModels, this includes testing their interactions with (mocked) dependencies, ensuring correct data flow and state management. UI flows will be manually tested for MVP, but code should be structured to maximize testability.

```

**Tasks:**
- Create new SwiftUI project
- Add Plaid Link SDK dependency
- Configure Info.plist for network requests
- Set up basic navigation structure

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Project builds without errors
- [ ] Plaid Link SDK integrated
- [ ] Network permissions configured
- [ ] Basic navigation structure implemented.
- [ ] Core services (`AuthService.swift`, `PlaidService.swift`, `BalanceService.swift`) have interfaces defined and initial structures allowing for mockable dependencies for testing. This ensures testability from the start.

### Step 4.2: Authentication Flow

**Views Required:**
- `LoginView.swift` - Email + PIN entry
- `AuthService.swift` - API communication

**Authentication Flow:**
1. Email entry screen
2. Code verification screen (if new user)
3. PIN entry screen
4. Main app

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] User can enter email and PIN for registration, and `AuthService.swift` handles this interaction, with logic unit tested.
    *   Example Unit Tests for `AuthService.swift` (Registration):
        *   `testRegister_withValidData_callsApiSuccessfullyAndHandlesSuccessResponse`: (Mocking network) Verifies the service correctly calls the backend registration endpoint and processes a successful response. Ensures client-side registration logic is sound.
        *   `testRegister_withInvalidData_handlesClientSideValidationErrorOrApiError`: Checks that the service handles invalid input locally or processes errors returned from the backend API during registration. Improves robustness.
- [ ] New users can set PIN (handled by registration).
- [ ] Existing users can login with email and PIN, and `AuthService.swift` handles this, with logic unit tested.
    *   Example Unit Tests for `AuthService.swift` (Login):
        *   `testLogin_withValidCredentials_callsApiAndStoresTokens`: (Mocking network & Keychain) Ensures the service calls the login endpoint, then securely stores the received access and refresh tokens. Core to establishing a session.
        *   `testLogin_withInvalidCredentials_returnsAppropriateError`: Verifies that backend-reported login failures are correctly processed and signaled by the service.
- [ ] PIN stored securely in Keychain (manual verification for MVP, focus on service logic tests for token storage).
- [ ] App remembers login state (e.g., via Keychain and token refresh), with token management logic in `AuthService.swift` unit tested.
    *   Example Unit Tests for `AuthService.swift` (Session Management):
        *   `testRefreshToken_ifAccessTokenIsExpired_successfullyGetsNewToken`: (Mocking network & Keychain) Checks that the service can use a stored refresh token to get a new access token if the current one is expired. Ensures session continuity.
        *   `testLogout_clearsStoredTokensFromKeychain`: Verifies that logging out removes sensitive token data from secure storage.
- [ ] `AuthService.swift` correctly handles success and error responses from the backend for auth operations, verified by unit tests (mocking network layer).
- [ ] Example Unit Tests for `LoginViewModel.swift` (or similar):
    *   `testLogin_whenAuthServiceSucceeds_updatesStateToAuthenticated`: Verifies the ViewModel correctly updates its state (e.g., for UI binding) upon successful login. Ensures UI reflects login status.
    *   `testLogin_whenAuthServiceFails_updatesStateWithError`: Checks the ViewModel updates its state to show an error if login fails. Ensures UI provides feedback on failure.
    *   `testPinValidation_withValidPin_isValidPropertyIsTrue`: Validates client-side PIN format validation logic if present.
    *   `testPinValidation_withInvalidPin_isValidPropertyIsFalse`: Ensures incorrect PIN formats are caught by client-side validation.

### Step 4.3: Plaid Link Integration

**Views Required:**
- `PlaidLinkView.swift` - Plaid Link integration ✅
- `AccountsView.swift` - Display connected accounts ✅

**Tasks:**
- Initialize Plaid Link with backend token ✅
- Handle successful bank connection ✅
- Display connected accounts list ✅
- Support multiple account connections ✅

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Plaid Link opens successfully when triggered.
- [x] Bank account connection completed, and `PlaidService.swift` handles token exchange with backend, with service logic unit tested (mocking network and Plaid SDK interactions where appropriate).
    *   Example Unit Tests for `PlaidService.swift`:
        *   `testFetchLinkToken_callsApiAndReturnsTokenForPlaidSdk`: (Mocking network) Ensures the service retrieves a Plaid Link token from the backend, needed to initialize the Plaid Link SDK. ✅
        *   `testExchangePublicToken_givenPlaidSdkSuccess_callsApiAndHandlesAccountResponse`: (Mocking network & Plaid SDK result) Verifies the service correctly sends the SDK's public token to the backend and processes the list of accounts received. Core to completing Plaid integration. ✅
- [x] Multiple accounts can be added.
- [x] Account list displays correctly based on data from `PlaidService.swift`/`BalanceService.swift` (ViewModel logic for this data presentation should be unit tested if applicable).
    *   Example Unit Tests for `AccountsViewModel.swift`:
        *   `testFetchAccounts_whenServiceReturnsData_updatesAccountListStateCorrectly`: Ensures the ViewModel populates its list of accounts for UI display when the backing service provides data. ✅
        *   `testFetchAccounts_whenServiceFails_updatesStateToShowError`: Checks that errors from the service layer (e.g., network failure) are reflected in the ViewModel's state for UI feedback. ✅
- [x] Account persistence system implemented - accounts saved to database and automatically loaded on app launch ✅
- [x] Professional UI with account categorization, smart icons, and modern design ✅
- [x] Comprehensive test coverage with 22+ passing tests following TDD methodology ✅
- [x] Production integration tested with 36 connected test accounts ✅
- [x] JSON decoding issues resolved and error handling implemented ✅

### Step 4.4: Category Configuration

**Views Required:**
- `CategoryConfigView.swift` - Inflow/Outflow toggles

**Interface Design:**
```
Account Categories

[Inflows] [Outflows]

☑ Chase Checking    ☐ Chase Checking
☑ Ally Savings      ☐ Ally Savings  
☐ Chase Credit      ☑ Chase Credit
```

**Tasks:**
- Create toggle interface for account categories
- Save category changes to backend
- Show current category assignments

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Users can toggle accounts between categories.
- [ ] Changes are sent to the backend via `BalanceService.swift`/`AccountService.swift`, with this service logic unit tested.
    *   Example Unit Tests for `BalanceService.swift` / `AccountService.swift` (Category Update):
        *   `testUpdateAccountCategories_callsApiWithCorrectParametersAndHandlesResponse`: (Mocking network) Verifies the service sends the user's category choices to the backend and correctly processes the response. Ensures user settings are saved remotely.
- [ ] Changes persist when app restarts (verified by fetching updated data).
- [ ] Clear visual indication of current settings.
- [ ] Accounts can be in both categories (no restriction).
- [ ] Example Unit Tests for `CategoryConfigViewModel.swift`:
    *   `testToggleCategory_updatesLocalStateAndCallsServiceToPersist`: Ensures that when a user toggles a category in the UI, the ViewModel updates its internal state and triggers the service call to save the change.
    *   `testLoadCategories_populatesViewModelWithCorrectAccountSettings`: Verifies the ViewModel correctly displays the current category settings for each account when data is loaded.

## Step 5: Widget Implementation

**Goal:** Create iOS widget showing monthly totals

**Testing Approach for Widget:** The `TimelineProvider` logic for fetching data and creating timeline entries should be unit tested. The widget UI itself will be primarily verified through manual testing and visual inspection for the MVP.

### Step 5.1: Widget Extension

**Files Required:**
- `TimWidget.swift` - Widget implementation
- `TimWidgetView.swift` - Widget UI
- `TimTimelineProvider.swift` - Update schedule

**Widget Design:**
```swift
struct TimWidgetView: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 4) {
            HStack {
                Text("+$\(inflow, specifier: "%.0f")")
                    .foregroundColor(.green)
                    .font(.system(size: 16, weight: .semibold))
                Spacer()
                Circle()
                    .fill(Color.green)
                    .frame(width: 8, height: 8)
            }
            
            HStack {
                Text("-$\(outflow, specifier: "%.0f")")
                    .foregroundColor(.red)
                    .font(.system(size: 16, weight: .semibold))
                Spacer()
                Circle()
                    .fill(Color.red)
                    .frame(width: 8, height: 8)
            }
        }
        .padding()
    }
}
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Widget appears on home screen
- [ ] Inflow displayed in green
- [ ] Outflow displayed in red
- [ ] Numbers formatted correctly
- [ ] Widget supports small size

### Step 5.2: Daily Updates

**Timeline Provider:**
- Updates every 24 hours
- Fetches latest balance data from API (via a shared service, ideally)
- Handles network failures gracefully

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Widget updates daily automatically.
- [ ] Network requests for balance data (e.g., through a shared `BalanceService.swift`) work from widget extension, with service logic unit tested (as covered in iOS App testing).
- [ ] `TimTimelineProvider.swift` correctly processes data (success and error cases) from the service and provides appropriate timeline entries, verified by unit tests.
    *   Example Unit Tests for `TimTimelineProvider.swift`:
        *   `testGetSnapshot_whenServiceReturnsData_providesCorrectEntryWithBalanceData`: (Mocking shared BalanceService) Ensures the provider creates a widget snapshot entry with the correct inflow/outflow data when the service call is successful. Verifies data flow to widget UI.
        *   `testGetSnapshot_whenServiceFails_providesErrorOrPlaceholderEntryForSnapshot`: Checks that if the initial data fetch for a snapshot fails, an appropriate placeholder/error entry is generated.
        *   `testGetTimeline_whenServiceReturnsData_providesCorrectEntriesAndFutureUpdatePolicy`: Verifies the provider generates a timeline of entries (e.g., for the next 24 hours) and sets the correct refresh policy when data is available.
        *   `testGetTimeline_whenServiceFails_providesErrorOrPlaceholderEntriesAndSensibleRefreshPolicy`: Ensures that if data fetching for the timeline fails, placeholder entries are provided and a reasonable refresh policy is still set (e.g., retry later).
- [ ] Fallback to cached data if network fails:
    - If cached data is available and < 48 hours old, display it with a subtle "Last updated: [X] ago" indicator.
    - If no cached data or data is >= 48 hours old, display placeholders (e.g., "+-- / -+--"). This conditional logic within the provider or view logic should be testable if possible.
    *   Example Unit Tests for `TimTimelineProvider.swift` (Cache/Error Handling in Entries):
        *   `testTimelineEntryCreation_withFreshCachedDataAndNetworkFailure_usesCachedData`: Confirms widget entries use cached data if it's recent and network fails.
        *   `testTimelineEntryCreation_withStaleCachedDataAndNetworkFailure_usesPlaceholders`: Ensures stale cache leads to placeholder display on network failure.
        *   `testTimelineEntryCreation_withNoCacheAndNetworkFailure_usesPlaceholders`: Verifies placeholder display when no cache is available and network fails.
- [ ] Timeline refreshes properly.

## Post-MVP Considerations

This section lists features and improvements deferred from the MVP to maintain a focused scope, but are valuable for future iterations:

- **Improved Plaid Error Handling & Re-authentication:** Implement a more user-friendly flow within the iOS app to guide users through re-authenticating Plaid items when `needs_reauthentication` is true (e.g., using Plaid Link in update mode).
- **User Account Deletion:** Provide an option for users to delete their accounts and ensure all associated data (including Plaid tokens and personal information) is securely removed.
- **Transaction History (Optional):** Consider if displaying categorized transactions (beyond balance changes) would add significant value, keeping in mind the app's discrete nature.
- **More Granular Notifications:** Allow users to configure notifications for large transactions or specific balance thresholds.
- **Wider Range of Account Types:** Explore explicit support for investment accounts or loans if user demand exists.

This simplified plan focuses on the core value proposition while keeping complexity minimal for weekend development.
