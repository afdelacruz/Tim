## Design Principles

- **Tim as Widget Setup Tool**: Focused on getting users to a working widget quickly
- **Minimal Re-engagement**: Most users will primarily use the widget, not the app
- **Tim's Presence**: Key moments only (onboarding, login corner, dashboard encouragement)
- **2-Tab Navigation**: Simplified from current 4-tab structure
- **Integrated Flow**: Plaid connection immediately followed by categorization

## How to Edit

Each wireframe file contains:
- **ASCII art layout** showing screen structure
- **Element descriptions** in brackets [like this]
- **Notes section** explaining design decisions
- **Measurements** for Tim character sizing

Feel free to:
- Modify layouts by editing the ASCII art
- Change element positions and sizes
- Update content and messaging
- Add or remove features
- Adjust Tim's presence and messaging

## Brand Guidelines

- **Background**: Cream (#FDFBD4)
- **Primary**: Black text and borders
- **Cards**: White background with black borders
- **Tim Character**: Your 600x600 PNG in various sizes
- **Typography**: Tim design system (casual sans serif)

## Implementation Priority

**Must Have (Weekend MVP):**
- Onboarding flow (screens 1-2)
- Enhanced login (screen 3)
- Account overview (screen 4)
- Integrated account flow (screen 5)
- Widget preview (screen 6)
- Functional dashboard (screen 7)

**Current vs. New:**
- Login/Register: ‚úÖ Exists, needs Tim branding update
- Dashboard: ‚úÖ Exists, needs simplification to 2-tab structure
- Account management: üîÑ Need to integrate Plaid + Category flows
- Onboarding: ‚ùå New screen needed
- Widget preview: ‚ùå New screen needed

## Notes

- All measurements are suggestions and can be adjusted
- Tim character sizing: Large (onboarding) ‚Üí Medium (dashboard) ‚Üí Small (login corner)
- Focus on widget setup completion over ongoing engagement
- Real user data in widget preview builds confidence
