# Issues and Ambiguities in PRD

This document outlines areas of ambiguity and missing details in the PRD that need clarification before implementation begins.

## Authentication System Issues

### Major Gap: No Password System Outlined
- **Issue:** PRD only mentions email-based registration with no password mechanism
- **Questions:**
  - How does login work with just an email?
  - Is this email-link based authentication? Magic links?
  - What's the email verification process?
  - How are users authenticated after initial registration?

### JWT Token Management
- **Missing Details:**
  - JWT expiration time not specified
  - No refresh token strategy outlined
  - Token rotation/invalidation not covered
  - Client-side token storage security beyond "Keychain" mention

## Real-time Updates Ambiguities

### Trigger Logic Missing
- **Unclear:** What exactly triggers a balance update?
  - Every transaction?
  - Daily batch processing?
  - Specific amount thresholds?
  - Manual refresh only?

### Push Notification Constraints
- **Issues:**
  - Push notification frequency limits not defined
  - iOS has daily limits on background app refresh
  - Widget update timing constraints unclear
  - Silent push vs regular push notification strategy undefined

### Webhook Processing
- **Missing:**
  - How to handle webhook failures/retries
  - Webhook payload validation specifics
  - Rate limiting on webhook endpoint
  - Duplicate webhook handling

## Plaid Integration Details

### Production Transition Strategy
- **Gaps:**
  - How to move from sandbox to production environment
  - Plaid access token expiration handling not covered
  - Token refresh mechanisms unclear
  - Multiple institution connection flow undefined

### Data Handling
- **Ambiguous:**
  - Multiple bank account aggregation logic unclear
  - How to handle accounts across different institutions
  - Account linking/unlinking user flow
  - Error scenarios not fully detailed (expired tokens, invalid accounts, etc.)

## Data & Business Logic Issues

### "Money In" vs "Money Out" Definition
- **Critical Ambiguity:**
  - How are pending transactions categorized?
  - What about transfers between user's own accounts?
  - How to handle refunds, reversals, adjustments?
  - Different account types (checking vs savings vs credit) treatment

### Currency and Internationalization
- **Missing:**
  - Currency handling for international accounts
  - Multi-currency display logic
  - Exchange rate considerations
  - Locale-specific number formatting

### Balance Calculation Logic
- **Unclear:**
  - Available balance vs current balance vs pending balance
  - How to aggregate balances across accounts
  - Handling of credit accounts (negative vs positive display)
  - Real-time vs cached balance priorities

## Technical Architecture Gaps

### iOS App Structure
- **Unspecified:**
  - State management approach (Combine? SwiftUI ObservableObject? Redux pattern?)
  - Navigation flow between views
  - Offline data caching strategy
  - Data persistence layer beyond Keychain for tokens

### Widget Implementation Details
- **iOS Limitations Not Addressed:**
  - Widget update frequency limitations (iOS restricts background updates)
  - Widget size constraints and responsive design
  - Widget configuration options for users
  - Timeline provider refresh strategy

### Backend Architecture
- **Missing Specifications:**
  - Database connection pooling configuration
  - API rate limiting strategy
  - Caching layer implementation
  - Background job processing for updates

## Security & Compliance Gaps

### Data Protection
- **Missing Details:**
  - Data encryption at rest specifications
  - Data encryption in transit beyond HTTPS
  - PCI DSS compliance requirements
  - GDPR/privacy compliance implementation

### API Security
- **Incomplete:**
  - API input validation specifics
  - SQL injection prevention measures
  - Security headers configuration (HSTS, CSP, etc.)
  - Request/response sanitization

### Access Control
- **Undefined:**
  - User session management
  - Device-specific authentication
  - Multi-device support strategy
  - Account lockout policies

## User Experience Issues

### Error Handling Specifics
- **Missing:**
  - Specific error message copy/content
  - Error recovery flows
  - Network connectivity handling
  - Graceful degradation strategies

### Accessibility & Usability
- **Not Addressed:**
  - Accessibility requirements (VoiceOver, Dynamic Type)
  - Dark mode support implementation
  - Internationalization/localization support
  - Loading state designs and animations

### User Onboarding
- **Unclear:**
  - First-time user experience flow
  - Bank connection guidance/help
  - Widget setup instructions
  - Permission request strategies (notifications, etc.)

## Deployment & Operations Issues

### Environment Configuration
- **Incomplete:**
  - Complete environment variables list
  - Staging vs production environment differences
  - Database migration strategy
  - Secrets management approach

### Monitoring & Maintenance
- **Missing:**
  - Application monitoring/logging strategy
  - Error tracking implementation
  - Performance monitoring
  - Update/maintenance schedules

### Scalability Considerations
- **Not Addressed:**
  - Database scaling strategy
  - API rate limiting and throttling
  - CDN requirements
  - Load balancing considerations

## App Store & Legal Issues

### App Store Compliance
- **Unclear:**
  - App Store review guidelines compliance
  - In-app purchase requirements (if any)
  - Data usage disclosure requirements
  - Third-party service integration disclosures

### Legal & Privacy
- **Missing:**
  - Privacy policy specific requirements
  - Terms of service scope
  - Data retention policies
  - User data deletion procedures

## Recommendations

1. **Prioritize authentication flow clarification** - This is foundational
2. **Define clear business rules** for money in/out categorization
3. **Specify iOS widget update constraints** early to avoid technical debt
4. **Create detailed error handling specifications**
5. **Define production deployment strategy** before backend development
6. **Clarify real-time update triggers** to properly scope webhook implementation
